# Earthdawn Character Generator

Personal project

## What Is This?

Based of the (originally) FASA RolePlaying Game, Earthcawn is a High-Magic Fantasy Post-Apocalypic game initially created in 1993.  This project is an attempt to utilize what I currenly know about Java coding to create a Character Generator for Players and potentially GameMasters as well.
